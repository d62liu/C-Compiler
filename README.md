# MiniC-PyCompiler

A simple **C subset compiler built in Python**.  
It walks through the classic compiler pipeline: **lexing → parsing → AST → execution**.  
---

## What it does
- Tokenizes basic C code (lexer)
- Builds an AST (parser)
- Runs programs with a minimal AST interpreter
- Written entirely in Python, no extra dependencies
